## Cookies, Web Server Data, & Other Technologies

Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and the 3rd parties we work with, use technologies such as web beacons or cookies on our Websites to improve user experience for our Website visitors. We may also use these technologies to better understand Website usage and to determine which areas of our Website users prefer. In some cases, to provide you better tailored programs and information, we may collect and consolidate your online information and match it with personal information collected from other 3rd party resources and programs. We may work with 3rd parties to help us with these activities. For example, if you are a healthcare provider, you may have a relationship with 3rd parties that share your personal information and online activities with others, such as pharmaceutical companies. Those 3rd parties may provide us with technologies that allow us to see when you have been on our Website while you are visiting, even if you have not contacted us directly or registered on our Website. In addition, cookies, web beacons, web server data, and other technologies may be used to provide you information and ads that BMS, Pfizer, and the 3rd parties we work with believe may be of interest to you. See ***Interest-Based Advertising*** section below.

- **Cookies.**  
  Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website and stored on the user’s web browser while the user is browsing a website. Cookies serve many functions, including but not limited to helping you log in (e.g., remembering your user name if you register or log in), remembering some of your customized user preferences, helping us better understand how people use our Website, collecting traffic data and helping us improve our Website. With respect to collecting traffic data, we may use 3rd parties to collect such data on our behalf. The data captured through the tracking technologies used by our Websites may be shared with our 3rd party advertising technology partners in order to provide you with targeted advertising that may appear on other websites you visit on the internet. These partners use technology to match cookies on your computer with cookies placed on your computer by other websites you may visit or have visited. These partners may also use cookies and other technologies (e.g., web beacons) to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone or laptop. Your browser can be set to manage cookies and even reject them. However, please keep in mind that by rejecting cookies, your user experience while visiting our Website will not be the same, functionality may be lost, and you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the Website.

- **Web Server Data & Other Technologies.**  
  Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer also use and allow certain 3rd parties to use other technologies, such as web beacons, on our Websites and in our digital communications. A web beacon is a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) that a company can place on its websites or in digital communications to allow it or a 3rd party (such as an internet advertising, audience measurement, or social media company) to collect and help it analyze advertising campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to their websites, to tailor advertising, or to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer use, and allow certain 3rd parties to use, web beacons on this Website and in digital communications for these purposes. In addition to provide you better tailored advertisements, programs, and information, we may also incorporate information collected from your browser and browsing activity in order to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone or laptop. As a result, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and these 3rd parties may collect and use information about your online visits to our Websites or engagement with our digital communications. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and these 3rd parties we work with may also collect usage data from our Websites such as the source address that a page request is coming from (e.g., IP address), domain name, date and time of the page request, the referring website (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). We use web server data and other technologies to better understand Website usage on the whole and to determine which areas of our website users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and these 3rd parties we work with store and use this information for statistical reporting.

## Interest-Based Advertising (lBA).

We may use 3rd party advertising companies to tailor online and mobile advertisements to you based on  predictions about your interests. Your interests could come from several sources including your browsing  activity, such as visits to our Websites from your browser and device or your response to online  advertisements. These 3rd parties collect and store data about your interests based on your online and  mobile activity using different technologies, such as placing or recognizing cookies on your browser,  recognizing device identifiers, or using pixel tags. These 3rd parties may also use these types of  technologies to recognize you across the devices you use. If you signed up with a 3rd party social media  site or subscription-based website or application, you should review the privacy policies of those  websites or applications to learn more about how you can opt-out of interest-based ads on those  websites or applications. For other interest-based ads, to opt out, you may click on the "AdChoices" icon  within the advertisement or website, which will take you to a page where you can learn more about interest-based advertising and manage or opt out of the online targeting technology from the 3rd parties  that we work with. AdChoices opt-outs are browser- and device-specific; therefore, you should repeat  your selections across each device and browser on which you wish to be opted out. If you opt out, you  may still see advertising from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer online or in mobile applications, but the  3rd parties we work with will not serve our ads based on predictions about your interests. Also, if you  delete or remove cookies or apps, your opt-out selections will not be stored. You should review your opt out preferences periodically, or update your choices to include new participating companies. In some  cases, the 3rd parties we work with may still collect data about your browsing activity and mobile  application activity for other purposes, but will not use this information to select our ads that you see. To  learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out in desktop and mobile, please visit  http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/. To opt out of interest based ads on mobile, you can download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices.

## Do-Not-Track Signals.

When you visit our Website, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and parties that we work  with, may collect and use traffic data through the use of cookies, web beacons, interest based ads, web server data, and other technologies as described in this Privacy Policy. The  collection of traffic data occurs even when do-not-track signals are enabled on your  internet browser. Under certain circumstances, we may be able to identify you when you  visit our Websites. For example, if you register on our Websites, we may be able to link  your personally identifiable information to previous visits on our Websites depending on  whether our Website cookies from earlier visits are still stored on your computer. For more  information about do-not-track signals, visit www.allaboutdnt.com.

## Security.

Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer take reasonable precautions to maintain the protection of personally  identifiable information collected through this Website and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  In addition to technical safeguards, we also use physical controls and procedures to safeguard your  personally identifiable information. However, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade our security measures or intercept transmissions over the  internet.

## Update and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information.

You may contact us to update or correct much of your personally identifiable information that you  provide to us through the Website other than the limited information described above under the ***Regulatory Requirements*** section or to opt out from our mailings and other services and  communications that you may have signed up for. To do so, please contact us at 855-ELIQUIS (354- 7847).

## State Rights (e.g., Access & Deletion for Certain Individuals).

You may have the right to request access to, or deletion of, your personal information under state law (e.g., California). These rights are not absolute and only apply in certain circumstances. This means that we may  be unable (e.g., due to legal requirements), or not obligated, to satisfy your request. In some cases, we may  need to collect additional information from you in order to verify your identity before we provide access or  delete your information, such as a government-issued identification. BMS will not discriminate against you  for exercising your rights, but may not be able to provide you with services or programs that you have  requested if we are not able to use your information. To submit requests please call 855-961-0474 or  complete the online form at www.bms.com/dpo/us/request.

## Changes in Our Privacy Policy.

We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting. You are bound by any such  revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the most current Privacy Policy.

## Online Privacy for Children.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not intend to collect personally  identifiable information from children under 18 years old. If a child has provided us with personally  identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child may contact us at 855- ELIQUIS (354- 7847).

## Policy on Use of Social Security Numbers.
