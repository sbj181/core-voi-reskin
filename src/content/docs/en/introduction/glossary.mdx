<GlossaryEntry 
	term="Benefits Review (BR)"
	icon="puzzle-piece"
>
	With a benefits review, patients can inquire whether ELIQUIS is covered by their health plan or prescription plan. The patient will be asked to provide their insurance information to the call center agent, who will then verify the coverage for ELIQUIS, including co-pay amount, formulary status, deductible, plan limitations, or prior authorization requirements, as applicable.
</GlossaryEntry>

<GlossaryEntry 
	term="Prior Authorization (PA) "
	icon="puzzle-piece"
>
	If a coverage restriction is identified, such as a prior authorization, the patient will be asked for their permission to contact the patient’s HCP office to notify them of the PA. ELIQUIS 360 will also provide the specific forms required by the health plan for a healthcare provider to initiate the PA process. The office can then prepare and submit the form to the plan. ELIQUIS 360 will follow up directly with the health plan to monitor the status of the prior authorization and then notify the HCP following the plan’s decision.
</GlossaryEntry>

<GlossaryEntry 
	term="Low Income Subsidy (LIS) Referrals"
	icon="puzzle-piece"
>
	If during a call to ELIQUIS 360 the patient expresses financial hardship, ELIQUIS 360 will offer to conduct a BR and will perform a high-level eligibility screen for possible LIS assistance based on the patient’s household size and income. If the patient appears to be eligible, ELIQUIS 360 will give instruction on how to apply for LIS assistance.
</GlossaryEntry>

<GlossaryEntry 
	term="Formulary Exception for Product Not Covered"
	icon="puzzle-piece"
>
	If through the BR process it is discovered that ELIQUIS is not covered, the patient support service will follow a similar process to the PA process. A formulary exception form will be sent to the HCP office, who can then prepare and submit to the plan. The formulary exception process requests formulary coverage when a plan does not cover a medicine. ELIQUIS 360 will follow up directly with the health plan to monitor the status of the formulary exception request and then notify the HCP following the plan’s decision.
</GlossaryEntry>

<GlossaryEntry 
	term="Tier Exception"
	icon="puzzle-piece"
>
	If through the benefit review process it is identified that ELIQUIS is being covered in a non-preferred tier, ELIQUIS 360 will follow a similar process to the PA process. A tier exception form will be sent to the HCP office who can then prepare and submit the form to the plan. ELIQUIS 360 will follow up directly with the health plan to monitor the status of the tier exception and then notify the HCP following the plan’s decision.
</GlossaryEntry>

<GlossaryEntry 
	term="Appeals Assistance"
	icon="puzzle-piece"
>
	If a PA, formulary exception, or tier exception is denied, ELIQUIS 360 can request the health plan’s process to appeal the denial. ELIQUIS 360 will provide the HCP with the necessary forms a to appeal the denial, which will then be prepared and submitted by the healthcare provider. ELIQUIS 360 will follow up directly with the health plan to monitor the status of the appeal and then notify the HCP following the plan’s decision.
	<br/>
	The HCP’s office will be responsible for completing and submitting all forms. Please keep in mind that PAs and formulary exceptions submitted by the HCP office are not guaranteed to be approved by the health plan, nor are appeals guaranteed to result in reversals of plan decisions.
	<br/>
	Representatives may not collect patient information or fill out or submit forms on behalf of the office.
